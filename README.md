# HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Analysis

This project analyzes HR data to understand the key factors contributing to employee attrition and builds a baseline machine learning model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave an organization.
The focus of this repository is clarity, clean structure, and practical analysis rather than overcomplicated modeling.

## Dataset

**HR Analytics Case Study – Kaggle**

Files used in this project:
- `general_data.csv` (primary dataset)

Other files provided in the dataset are intentionally not used to keep the analysis focused and readable.

## Project Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature encoding and scaling  
5. Train–test split  
6. Logistic Regression model building  
7. Model evaluation using classification metrics
   
## Techniques and Tools

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- Employee attrition is higher among employees with lower monthly income.
- Business travel frequency shows a noticeable relationship with attrition.
- Several demographic and job-related features contribute to attrition risk.
- Logistic Regression provides a strong and interpretable baseline model for this problem.
